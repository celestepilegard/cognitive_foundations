               recollection of specific putts among experts indicated that

               performance without the need for step-by-step attentional
               control. According to explicit monitoring theories of choking,
               such proceduralization makes putting vulnerable to decrements
               under pressure. Experiments 3-4 examined choking and the ability
               of training conditions to ameliorate it in putting and a
               nonproceduralized alphabet arithmetic skill analogous to mental
               arithmetic. Choking occurred in putting but not alphabet
               arithmetic. In putting, choking was unchanged by dual-task
               training but eliminated by self-consciousness training. These

               direction reveals that we are surprisingly unaware of the
               details of our environment from one view to the next: we often
               do not detect large changes to objects and scenes ('change
               blindness'). Furthermore, without attention, we may not even
               perceive objects ('inattentional blindness'). Taken together,
               these findings suggest that we perceive and remember only those
               objects and details that receive focused attention. In this
               paper, we briefly review and discuss evidence for these

               builds on classic studies of divided visual attention to examine
               inattentional blindness for complex objects and events in

               noticing an unexpected object depends on the similarity of that
               object to other objects in the display and on how difficult the
               priming monitoring task is. Interestingly, spatial proximity of
               the critical unattended object to attended locations does not

               Performance was not disrupted by listening to radio broadcasts
               or listening to a book on tape. Nor was it disrupted by a

               Moreover unconstrained conversations using either a handheld or

               working memory. Over the years, this has been successful in
               giving an integrated account not only of data from normal
               adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental and
               neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number of phenomena
               that are not readily captured by the original model. These are
               outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic
               buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that
               provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal
               code, which is capable of binding information from the
               subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary
               episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be
               the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised

               the processes of integrating information, rather than on the

               possess of perceiving only one acoustic world under normal
               conditions (in spite of having two ears) and yet, if our ears be
               stimulated by different signals, artificially, we can attend to
               one or the other of them. The tests have been made with
               continuous speech (readings from light fiction) and the results
               assessed statistically. The first tests aim at measuring the
               reaction time r required to ``switch the attention'' from one
               ear to the other, as assessed by perception of the words of the
               message. A second set of tests show that we perceive only one

               (``Inhibition'')-and their roles in complex ``frontal lobe'' or
               ``executive'' tasks. One hundred thirty-seven college students
               performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are
               considered to predominantly tap each target executive function
               as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the
               Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random
               number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking.
               Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target
               executive functions are moderately correlated with one another,
               but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation
               modeling suggested that the three functions contribute
               differentially to performance on complex executive tasks.
               Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to
               Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and
               operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not
               related to any of the three target functions. These results

  abstract  = "Attempts to measure advertising effectiveness have relied on
               explicit memory measures based on recall or recognition.
               However, recent cognitive research has shown that not only is it
               possible to measure unconscious effects of prior experience
               through implicit tests of memory, but that such performance is
               independent of explicit recollection. The present study sought
               to determine whether it is possible to demonstrate the same
               pattern of findings using print advertising in an ecologically
               valid situation. Eighty subjects saw 25 full‐page colour
               magazine adverts in either a deliberate or incidental study
               condition and subsequently rated (on four salient dimensions) a
               set of 50 adverts, which included the target adverts. Following
               the ratings subjects were asked to indicate which of the adverts
               they recognized as having been in the original set. While the
               deliberate study group recognized around 60 per cent of the
               adverts, the incidental study group recognized only 11 per cent.
               However, both groups showed the same positive bias in attitudes
               towards the adverts they had been exposed to compared to the
               ones they had not seen before. Thus, in line with by the
               cognitive literature, it is possible to show shifts in attitudes
               that are independent of conscious recollection. This data

               ``filtering'' (Broadbent, 1958). The experiments extend Cherry's
               finding (1953) that Ss noticed if the rejected message was
               identical to the selected one but a few seconds out of step. It
               was shown that (a) the comparison between the messages must be
               made at a central level, and required the identification of
               words and meaning rather than a simple analysis of the sounds,
               since Ss noticed the identity of the messages even when they
               were in different voices or different languages; (b) their
               identity is noticed at a 5-sec interval when a selected message
               of coherent prose leads the rejected one in time, but at 1 or 2

               Treisman's suggestion (1960) that the filter acts by attenuating
               rather than blocking irrelevant signals. The second may give a
               measure of the different storage times for selected and rejected
               material. The critical delay interval for recognition also
               varied with the verbal content of the selected message: it

               retrieval provides an additional presentation of the target
               item. Two methods of learning paired associates were compared.
               In the pure study trial (pure ST condition) method, both items
               of a pair were presented simultaneously for study. In the test
               trial/study trial (TTST condition) method, subjects attempted to
               retrieve the response term during a period in which only the
               stimulus term was present (and the response term of the pair was
               presented after a 5-sec delay). Final retention of target items
               was tested with cued-recall tests. In Experiment 1, there was a
               reliable advantage in final testing for nonsense-syllable/number
               pairs in the TTST condition over pairs in the pure ST condition.
               In Experiment 2, the same result was obtained with
               Eskimo/English word pairs. This benefit of the TTST condition
               was not apparently different for final retrieval after 5 min or
               after 24 h. Experiments 3 and 4 ruled out two artifactual
               explanations of the TTST advantage observed in the first two
               experiments. Because performing a memory retrieval (TTST

               occurred with ketamine, phencyclidine, MK-801 and CGS 19755;
               rats trained with any of these NMDA antagonists failed to show
               response transfer when tested with saline. Also, in rats trained
               with saline the response failed to transfer in tests with any of
               these drugs. The doses at which the failure to transfer occurred
               in drug-to-saline tests, were approximately 3-fold lower than
               those at which the failure occurred in saline-to-drug tests.
               Even higher doses of these compounds were required to inhibit

               disorganize the behavior of animals and, perhaps also, of
               humans. The data do not support the widely held notion that NMDA
               antagonists produce deficits in memory or retention; instead, at
               doses considerably lower than those impairing acquisition, NMDA
               antagonists produce a state upon which the recall of the newly

               for human memory performance. Meanwhile, human and animal
               studies have demonstrated that learning-related neural activity
               is re-expressed during posttraining nonrapid eye movement (NREM)
               sleep. NREM sleep processes appear to be particularly beneficial
               for hippocampus-dependent forms of memory. These observations
               suggest that learning triggers the reactivation and
               reorganization of memory traces during sleep, a systems-level
               process that in turn enhances behavioral performance. Here, we
               hypothesized that dreaming about a learning experience during
               NREM sleep would be associated with improved performance on a
               hippocampus-dependent spatial memory task. Subjects were trained
               on a virtual navigation task and then retested on the same task
               5 hr after initial training. Improved performance at retest was
               strongly associated with task-related dream imagery during an
               intervening afternoon nap. Task-related thoughts during
               wakefulness, in contrast, did not predict improved performance.
               These observations suggest that sleep-dependent memory
               consolidation in humans is facilitated by the offline
               reactivation of recently formed memories, and furthermore that
               dream experiences reflect this memory processing. That similar

               hypotheses about the use of schemata in memory performance: (a)
               that schemata determine what objects are encoded into memory;
               (b) that schemata act as frameworks for episodic information;
               (c) that schema-based information is integrated with episodic
               information; (d) that schemata facilitate retrieval; and (e)
               that schemata influence what is communicated at recall. Subjects
               were taken into what they thought was a graduate student's
               office and later were tested for memory of the room with either
               drawing recall, written recall, or verbal recognition. Memory
               scores for objects were correlated with schema expectancy and
               saliency ratings. Schema expectancy was positively correlated
               with recall and recognition. Expected objects were inferred in
               recall, supporting the integration hypothesis. Comparison of
               recall and recognition data supported the retrieval hypothesis.
               Analysis of the written descriptions supported the communication
               hypothesis. Saliency was positively correlated with recall and
               recognition for present objects, but was unrelated to retrieval.
               Saliency was negatively correlated with recognition for

               Go Wrong,'' published in 2011, tells the story of the first 250
               DNA exonerations in the United States. There have now been 330
               DNA exonerations. There is no other country in the world in
               which such a large group of people have been exonerated by DNA
               evidence. This Chapter updates data collected when researching
               the book, and in many respects, the patterns remain the same.
               Many faced quite severe sentences. Twenty exonerees had been
               sentenced to death. Ninety-two were sentenced to life in prison,
               12 of which were sentenced to life without parole. The vast
               majority, 80 percent of these DNA exonerees, were racial
               minorities. There have been some notable changes in the
               composition of the most recent set of DNA exonerations. The more
               recent DNA exonerations include far more murder convictions than
               the first 250 DNA exonerations. These changes have impacted the
               types of evidence prominent in the cases. Similarly high
               percentages of cases involve eyewitness misidentifications
               (70\%) and forensics (69\%). Most striking, more of the cases
               include false confessions (21\%) and informant testimony (22\%).
               Many of the most recent exonerations were particularly hard
               fought along the path to eventual exoneration. Often because
               prosecutors were swayed by confession evidence they continued to
               litigated cases for years, even despite DNA tests results.
               Indeed, 22 of the recent 80 cases involved DNA analysis, 18 of
               which DNA exclusions of individuals that were nevertheless
               convicted; 3 more of which involved DNA exclusions concealed
               from the defense, and one more case, which involved a sample
               mix-up leading to an error in DNA analysis. Of the 227 cases
               that involved forensic evidence, 46\% or 105 cases, involved
               invalid, erroneous, or concealed forensics. Almost half of the
               cases with eyewitness identifications involved cross-racial
               identifications. Twenty-nine of these inmates received vacaturs
               during appeals or post-conviction occurring prior to their DNA
               exonerations, representing 14\% of the 204 that had written
               decisions published by judges. These most recent exonerations
               are particularly troubling, because some of the same underlying
               practices that can lead to wrongful convictions are with us
               today, even if reforms are spreading and attitudes towards
               criminal justice are shifting.",

  abstract  = "Scientific discussions about false memories have, so far, mainly
               focused on external determinants (e.g., therapeutic
               interventions). However, in some cases, false memories might
               develop more spontaneously. For example, difficulties in
               distinguishing between dreams and reality may lead to false
               memories. The present article discusses two studies (N = 85 and
               255, respectively) that examined to what extent such
               difficulties occur. In both studies, a nontrivial minority of
               respondents (11.8\% and 25.9\%, respectively) reported that they
               had had the experience of not being able to discriminate between
               dream and reality. As expected, respondents who reported this
               type of confusion scored higher on fantasy proneness and
               dissociation measures than respondents who did not report this

               evaluators' abilities to discriminate between accurate and

               Each then gave videotaped testimony about their identification,

               believe the testimony of mistaken eyewitnesses, indicating

               nonhuman animals or human infants lack the capacity to represent
               abstract concepts. In particular, it argues that the initial
               state includes several systems of core cognition with long
               evolutionary histories. Core cognition includes abstract
               concepts with conceptual content. Second, nonetheless, there are
               discontinuities in conceptual development at two different
               levels of generality. At a general level, most human concepts
               differ from those embedded in core cognition in many ways, and,
               at a specific level, core cognition does not have the resources
               to represent most specific abstract concepts. Third, it
               characterizes one class of learning mechanism that underlies the
               discontinuities of interest: Quinian bootstrapping. With this
               analysis in hand, the chapter speculates on some aspects of
               conceptual representations unique to humans. These points are

               formation and representation in a standard concept acquisition
               task. The primary comparison was among arbitrary concepts, which
               had meaningless features; meaningful concepts, which had
               meaningful features from different domains; and integrated
               concepts, which had meaningful features interconnected by common
               knowledge. Experiment 1 found that learning was superior for the
               integrated concepts but that there was little difference as a
               function of feature meaningfulness. Experiment 2 suggested that
               the integrated Ss were learning to form a knowledge-based schema
               as their concept representation because they did not distinguish
               the typicality of features that differed in frequency.
               Experiment 3 introduced a category whose features were from the
               same domain but were not otherwise related. This concept was as
               difficult to learn and use as the meaningful concepts were.
               These comparisons help specify the ways in which knowledge does
               and does not influence concept formation.",

  abstract  = "When people are asked to decide whether an object is in a given
               category, they generally respond faster when the category is at
               the basic level (e.g., car) than when it is at the superordinate
               level (e.g., vehicle) or the subordinate level (e.g., sedan).
               Basic categories have shorter and more frequent names, are
               learned earlier, and are usually more highly differentiated than
               other categories (they are both specific and distinctive), but
               it is not clear which of these factors is responsible for the
               faster response to basic categories. In three experiments with
               natural language categories, we found evidence that objects can
               be identified fastest as members of differentiated categories,
               even when such categories have longer names and are learned
               later than less differentiated categories. Specifically, we
               argued that atypical subordinate categories (e.g., racing car)
               are highly differentiated and should therefore be responded to
               as fast as basic categories in object recognition. The results
               supported this view and also ruled out the hypothesis that
               objects are necessarily identified as members of basic
               categories before further identification. We discuss the

               objects, there is one level of abstraction at which the most
               basic category cuts are made. Basic categories are those which
               carry the most information, possess the highest category cue
               validity, and are, thus, the most differentiated from one
               another. The four experiments of Part I define basic objects by
               demonstrating that in taxonomies of common concrete nouns in

               impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In
               fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the
               direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity
               can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization.
               This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a
               cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes
               decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive
               linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal
               characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the
               diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages.
               After surveying the various uses of ``universal,'' we illustrate
               the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and
               syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the
               core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and
               grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent
               patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable

               METHODS: Participants were randomized to PA (n = 19) or
               sedentary attention control (n = 16) programs. Academic records,
               curriculum-based measures, and classroom observations were
               obtained at baseline, postintervention, and/or follow-up. Mixed
               models tested group $\times$ time interactions on academic
               records and curriculum-based measures. One-way analysis of
               variance or Kruskal-Wallis tested for differences in
               postintervention classroom observations. RESULTS:
               Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated a moderate effect within
               groups from baseline to postintervention on disciplinary
               referrals (PA: d = -0.47; attention control: d = -0.36) and a
               null moderate effect on academic assessments (PA: d = 0.11 to
               0.36; attention control: d = 0.05 to 0.40). No significant group
               $\times$ time interactions emerged on direct academic
               assessments (all Ps $\geq$ .05, d = -0.23 to 0.26) or academic
               records (all Ps $\geq$ .05, d = -0.28 to 0.16). Classroom
               observations revealed that intervention participants were
               off-task due to moving at twice the rate of comparative
               classmates (F = 15.74, P < .001) and were off-task due to
               talking 33\% more often (F = 1.39, P = .257). CONCLUSION:
               Academic outcome improvements were small within and between
               groups and did not sustain at follow-up. Academic benefits of
               after-school PA programs for children with attention-deficit

               in that they are structured at the level both of sentence and of
               word. Although the inclination to use gesture may be traceable
               to the fact that the deaf children's hearing parents, like all

               responsible for introducing language-like structure into their

               only within a critical period, extending from early infancy
               until puberty. In its basic form, the critical period hypothesis
               need only have consequences for first language acquisition.
               Nevertheless, it is essential to our understanding of the nature
               of the hypothesized critical period to determine whether or not
               it extends as well to second language acquisition. If so, it
               should be the case that young children are better second
               language learners than adults and should consequently reach
               higher levels of final proficiency in the second language. This
               prediction was tested by comparing the English proficiency
               attained by 46 native Korean or Chinese speakers who had arrived
               in the United States between the ages of 3 and 39, and who had
               lived in the United States between 3 and 26 years by the time of
               testing. These subjects were tested on a wide variety of
               structures of English grammar, using a grammaticality judgment
               task. Both correlational and t-test analyses demonstrated a
               clear and strong advantage for earlier arrivals over the later
               arrivals. Test performance was linearly related to age of
               arrival up to puberty; after puberty, performance was low but
               highly variable and unrelated to age of arrival. This age effect
               was shown not to be an inadvertent result of differences in
               amount of experience with English, motivation,
               self-consciousness, or American identification. The effect also
               appeared on every grammatical structure tested, although the
               structures varied markedly in the degree to which they were well
               mastered by later learners. The results support the conclusion

  abstract  = "These experiments test the hypothesis that preschool children
               are predisposed to interpret nouns as referring to taxonomic
               relations, and that this bias guides the early establishment of
               conceptual hierarchies (e.g., collie, dog, mammal, animal. Two
               familiar hierarchies---animals and food---and two linguistic
               form classes---nouns and adjectives---were examined in detail.
               Experiment 1 tested the effect of introducing novel nouns at
               multiple hierarchical levels (subordinate, basic, intermediate,
               and superordinate). Some children were introduced to novel nouns
               for the classes (e.g., suikahs); others heard no labels. Nouns
               facilitated superordinate level classification, but made
               subordinate classification more difficult. In Experiment 2,
               another group of children labeled the classes to enable a direct
               comparison of preschoolers' linguistic descriptions and
               conceptual groupings. They tended to label all subordinate
               classes identically (e.g., they labeled all subclasses of dogs
               as `dogs'), yet when they were explicitly instructed to
               distinguish them, they used adjectival phrases (e.g., `big
               dogs'). In Experiment 3, novel labels were presented in two
               different linguistic contexts, either as nouns (e.g., suikahs)
               or as adjectives (e.g., suk-ish ones). As in Experiment 1, nouns
               made subordinate classification more difficult. Conversely,
               adjectival phrases facilitated subordinate classification, but
               made superordinate classification more difficult. Children's
               early sensitivity to the different applications of nouns and
               adjectives served to guide the establishment of conceptual
               hierarchies.",

               reproduces a chess position after viewing it for 5 sec. The
               successive glances at the position in the perceptual task and

               the use of analogies were discussed theoretically and explored
               in five experiments. In Experiment I oral protocols were used to
               examine the processes involved in solving a problem by analogy.
               In all experiments subjects who first read a story about a
               military problem and its solution tended to generate analogous
               solutions to a medical problem (Duncker's ``radiation
               problem''), provided they were given a hint to use the story to
               help solve the problem. Transfer frequency was reduced when the
               problem presented in the military story was substantially
               disanalogous to the radiation problem, even though the solution
               illustrated in the story corresponded to an effective radiation
               solution (Experiment II). Subjects in Experiment III tended to
               generate analogous solutions to the radiation problem after
               providing their own solutions to the military problem. Subjects
               were able to retrieve the story from memory and use it to
               generate an analogous solution, even when the critical story had
               been memorized in the context of two distractor stories
               (Experiment IV). However, when no hint to consider the story was
               given, frequency of analogous solutions decreased markedly. This
               decrease in transfer occurred when the story analogy was
               presented in a recall task along with distractor stories
               (Experiment IV), when it was presented alone, and when it was
               presented in between two attempts to solve the problem
               (Experiment V). Component processes and strategic variations in
               analogical problem solving were discussed. Issues related to
               noticing analogies and accessing them in memory were also

               analogies will be noticed on the basis of semantic retrieval
               cues and that the induction of a general schema from concrete
               analogs will facilitate analogical transfer. These predictions
               were tested in experiments in which subjects first read one or
               more stories illustrating problems and their solutions and then
               attempted to solve a disparate but analogous transfer problem.
               The studies in Part I attempted to foster the abstraction of a
               problem schema from a single story analog by means of
               summarization instructions, a verbal statement of the underlying
               principle, or a diagrammatic representation of it. None of these
               devices achieved a notable degree of sucess. In contrast, the
               experiments in Part II demonstrated that if two prior analogs
               were given, subjects often derived a problem schema as an
               incidental product of describing the similarities of the
               analogs. The quality of the induced schema was highly predictive
               of subsequent transfer performance. Furthermore, the verbal
               statements and diagrams that had failed to facilitate transfer
               from one analog proved highly beneficial when paired with two.
